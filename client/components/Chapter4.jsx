      Unlike the balance sheet, which covers one moment in time (like a snapshot), the income statement provides performance information about a time period.

      If the income statement of a company shows good profits over a number of years, it indicates a healthy balance sheet. But having a healthy balance sheet does not necessarily means that a company will have a strong income statement as well. For example, it is possible that in a certain accounting period, a company may suffer loss, but the balance sheet position of a company may not be affected by that loss.
