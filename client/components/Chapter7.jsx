      Forecasting financial statements can allow you to make a prediction of what next years's
      balance sheet or income statement would look like.
      It's much easier to change your plan at the start of the year to make it successful rather
      than waiting to see how things pan out over time. That's the importance of forecasting!

      Imagine operating your business for half the year, only to find yourself in an
      emergency situation where you need to go to your shareholders and get them to put
      in $100 each, only to find out that they cannot afford that at the moment. With a
      forecast of your financial statements, the need for extra funding can be scoped out at
      the start of the year, and then you can be flexible in your approach to receiving funding.

      Financial forecasting helps us to see our financial needs well in advance using the structure
      of accounting (essentially, ASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY). Let that discipline allow us to
      take our assumptions about a year, put them into a forecasted income statement, put them
      into a forecasted balance sheet, and then see, does this work?
      Is this internally consistent? Are we going to need to borrow more money?
      Are we going to need to get new shareholder investment?
